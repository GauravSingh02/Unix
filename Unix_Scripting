#! symbol, also known as a shebang or hashbang,
This tells the system to use the Bash interpreter to execute the script

#### How to identify those deployment completion
#!/bin/bash

# Define the path to your server log file
log_file="path/to/your/server/logs.txt"

# Define the specific API endpoint you want to track
specific_api_endpoint="/api/endpoint"

# Use grep to count the occurrences of the specific API endpoint in the log file
total_api_calls=$(grep -c "$specific_api_endpoint" "$log_file")

# Print the result
echo "Total number of '$specific_api_endpoint' API calls: $total_api_calls"

================================================================================
### RTM to check no of API calls for specific pattern 
#!/bin/bash

# Define the list of servers (replace with your server IPs or hostnames)
servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")

# Define the path to the server log file on each server
log_file_path="/path/to/your/server/logs.txt"

# Define the specific API endpoint you want to track
specific_api_endpoint="/api/endpoint"

# Function to count API calls on a specific server
count_api_calls() {
    server="$1"
    ssh "$server" "grep -c '$specific_api_endpoint' '$log_file_path'"
}

# Initialize total API calls counter
total_api_calls=0

# Loop through each server and count API calls
for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
    echo "Checking server: $server"
    api_calls_on_server=$(count_api_calls "$server")
    echo "Total API calls on $server: $api_calls_on_server"
    total_api_calls=$((total_api_calls + api_calls_on_server))
done

# Print the aggregated result
echo "Total number of '$specific_api_endpoint' API calls across all servers: $total_api_calls"
