####### ps command ######

# To get "full" information about each process.
$ ps -f 

# If You're typically interested in Full information about all the processes running on the system
$ ps -ef

$ ps auxw 

The a argument means "show all processes", not just my processes. (There's a bit more to it than that, but this is usually close enough.)
The u argument adds "user information" columns to the output. (Try your ps command without the 'u', and you'll see a major difference in the columns that are displayed.)
The x lifts the BSD-style "must have a tty" restriction, meaning it will show processes that are not associated with a terminal (tty)>
The w means "wide output". Use this option twice for unlimited width.

ps -ef | grep mysql

Zoombie process

ps -e -o pid,ppid,state,command | grep -w Z
